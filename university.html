    <h3>
        Think of Cyber Security, think of MVGR College of Engineering. After my B.Tech / wanted to do Cyber Security and
        I heard
        of this college as the best to offer M.Tech in Networks and Security. Today with the continuous support of our
        faculty
        and excellent training given by the Cisco Networking Academy instructors, I am very fortunate enough to be
        selected in
        Cisco as an Intern with Rs. 80,000/ stipend. I thank all my M.Tech faculty, our M.Tech coordinator, our HOD and
        the Cisco Networking Academy instructors for what I am today.
