<!--
Explanation:
<script> Tag:
The first <script> tag contains JavaScript code to define a function.

function getcube(number):
This line defines a JavaScript function named getcube(), which accepts a single argument, number.
Function: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Here, the function will calculate the cube of the number passed to it.

alert(number * number * number);:
Inside the function, the alert() method is used. This method pops up a dialog box displaying the result of the calculation.
The calculation number * number * number computes the cube of the provided number (i.e., the number raised to the power of 3).

document.write(getcube(3));:
This line calls the getcube() function, passing 3 as the argument.
getcube(3) will calculate the cube of 3 (which is 27) and then display an alert with the result (27).

Important: The value returned by the getcube() function is undefined because the function doesn't have a return statement. It only uses alert() to show the result.
document.write(): This method writes the returned value (which is undefined) to the document. So, undefined will be written to the page where the script is executed.
In this case, the actual output on the page will show the string undefined.
