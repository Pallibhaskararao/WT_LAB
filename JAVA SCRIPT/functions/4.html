<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
<p>This example calls a function which performs a calculation, and returns the result:</p>
<script>
function myFunction(p1, p2) 
{
  return p1 * p2;  // Multiplies two parameters
}
document.write(myFunction(4, 3));  // Displays result of 4 * 3
</script>
</body>
</html>

<!--
Explanation:
<script> Tag:

This tag contains the JavaScript code. Everything inside this tag is executed by the browser as JavaScript when the page is loaded.

function myFunction(p1, p2):
This is a JavaScript function named myFunction that takes two parameters, p1 and p2.
Function: A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task when called.
Parameters: The parameters p1 and p2 are placeholders for values that will be passed into the function when it is called.

return p1 * p2;:
This line inside the function multiplies the two parameters p1 and p2 and returns the result.
Return Statement: The return keyword specifies the value that will be returned by the function. In this case, it returns the product of p1 and p2.

document.write(myFunction(4, 3));:
This line calls the myFunction() function with the values 4 and 3 as arguments.
The function calculates the result of 4 * 3 (which equals 12).
The result, 12, is then passed to document.write(), which writes that value to the webpage.

document.write(): This method writes the specified text (in this case, 12) directly to the HTML document.
