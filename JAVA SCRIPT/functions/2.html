<!--
Explanation:
<script type="text/javascript">: This tag is used to define JavaScript code. The type="text/javascript" attribute is technically optional in modern browsers but was historically used to specify the script type.

function sayHello():
A JavaScript function named sayHello() is defined. Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task when called.
In this case, the function contains one statement:

document.write("Hello there!");:
The document.write() method writes text directly to the HTML document where it's called.
Here, the text "Hello there!" is written to the page when the function sayHello() is invoked.
Note: Since this function is defined but not yet called in the <head> section, nothing will appear immediately on the page at this point in time.

The <form> and <input> Elements:
The <form> tag is a container for form controls (such as buttons, text inputs, checkboxes, etc.). In this case, it contains a button:
<input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say Hello">:
This creates a button on the page with the label "Say Hello".
onclick="sayHello()": The onclick attribute specifies an event handler for the click event. When the user clicks this button, the sayHello() function will be called.
value="Say Hello": The value attribute specifies the text that appears on the button.
