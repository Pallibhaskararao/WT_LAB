<!--
Explanation:

function sayHello():
A JavaScript function named sayHello() is defined.
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called. In this case, the sayHello() function writes a string to the document.

document.write("Hello there!<br><br>");:
This is the main action of the sayHello() function.
document.write() is a JavaScript method that writes content directly to the HTML document.
The string "Hello there!" is displayed on the page.
The <br><br> at the end of the string ensures that two line breaks are inserted after the text, creating space before any subsequent content.

sayHello();:
This line immediately calls the sayHello() function after its definition in the <head> section.
When the page is loaded, the function runs, and the text "Hello there!" is written to the page.
