Explanation:
1. The .container:
This div acts as the container holding the three overlapping boxes.
It is given a relative position, so we can position the child elements (box1, box2, box3) absolutely within this container.
2. .box1 (Red Box):
Positioned using absolute and placed at 50px from the top and 50px from the left of the container.
Has a z-index of 1, meaning it will be at the back of the stacking order.
3. .box2 (Green Box):
Positioned using absolute and placed at 100px from the top and 100px from the left of the container.
Has a z-index of 2, meaning it will be in front of box1 (Red Box).
4. .box3 (Blue Box):
Positioned using absolute and placed at 150px from the top and 150px from the left of the container.
Has a z-index of 3, meaning it will be in front of both box1 and box2.

Stacking Order Explanation:
1. Box 1 (Red) has the smallest z-index value (1), so it will be stacked at the back.
2. Box 2 (Green) has a z-index of 2, so it will be stacked above Box 1.
3. Box 3 (Blue) has the largest z-index value (3), so it will appear on top of both Box 1 and Box 2.

Key Points About z-index:
1. The z-index only works if the element has a position value other than static (the default).
relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky positions work with z-index.
2. Higher z-index values place an element in front of elements with lower z-index values.
3. Negative values can be used to move an element behind other elements.

Important Considerations:
1. Stacking Context: Each positioned element creates a new stacking context, so z-index values are relative to other elements within the same stacking context.
2. Overlapping Elements: When multiple elements overlap, you can control which elements are visible by adjusting their z-index. -->
