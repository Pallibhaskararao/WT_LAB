    <p>This image will adjust based on the screen size using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes.</p>

    <!-- Responsive Image Example -->
    <img 
        src="https://wallpapers.com/images/high/lighthouse-silhouette-kofhpvhvejp0jzu2.webp" 
        alt="Lighthouse Silhouette" 
        title="Lighthouse Silhouette"
        srcset="https://wallpapers.com/images/high/lighthouse-silhouette-kofhpvhvejp0jzu2.webp 500w, https://wallpapers.com/images/high/lighthouse-silhouette-kofhpvhvejp0jzu2.webp 1000w, https://wallpapers.com/images/high/lighthouse-silhouette-kofhpvhvejp0jzu2.webp 1500w"
        sizes="(max-width: 600px) 500px, (max-width: 1200px) 1000px, 1500px"
    />

    <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> allows the image to be loaded in various sizes depending on the screen resolution and viewport size.</p>

<!-- 
Explanation:
src:
This is the fallback image, which is used if the srcset is not supported.
The image is loaded from the provided URL: https://wallpapers.com/images/high/lighthouse-silhouette-kofhpvhvejp0jzu2.webp.

alt:
This provides a text description of the image for accessibility purposes. It is especially useful for screen readers or if the image fails to load.
In this case, it's set to "Lighthouse Silhouette".

title:
This provides a tooltip when the user hovers over the image. It's set to "Lighthouse Silhouette" here.

srcset:
Specifies multiple image sources for different screen sizes. Here, the same image is used with different resolutions (500px, 1000px, and 1500px).
This allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on the device's screen size and resolution.

sizes:
This specifies the expected display size of the image at different viewport widths. The browser uses this to decide which image to download based on the screen size.
If the viewport is 600px wide or less, it loads the 500px wide image.
For screen widths between 601px and 1200px, it loads the 1000px wide image.
For screen widths larger than 1200px, it loads the 1500px wide image.
