<!--
Explanation of CSS Pseudo-Classes Used:
1. :visited:
Purpose: This pseudo-class applies styles to links that the user has already visited. It helps to differentiate visited links from unvisited ones.
2. :hover:
Purpose: This pseudo-class applies styles when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the link. It's typically used to create interactive effects, such as changing the background or text color.
3. :active:
Purpose: This pseudo-class applies styles to the link when it is actively being clicked (i.e., when the mouse button is pressed down). This is often used to provide visual feedback for click actions.
4. :focus (Bonus):
Purpose: This pseudo-class applies styles when the link has keyboard focus (e.g., when it's selected using the Tab key or clicked).
